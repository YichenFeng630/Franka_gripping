# Detection Parameters for Franka Perception

# Point Cloud Processing
voxel_size: 0.006              # Voxel grid size for downsampling (meters) - LARGE WORKSPACE
z_min: -0.8                     # Minimum Z coordinate relative to camera (meters) - camera looks down
z_max: 0.3                      # Maximum Z coordinate relative to camera (meters)

# RANSAC Plane Removal (Table Surface)
ransac_dist: 0.025              # Distance threshold for RANSAC inliers (meters) - LARGE WORKSPACE
ransac_iterations: 100          # Number of RANSAC iterations

# DBSCAN Clustering
dbscan_eps: 0.035                # DBSCAN epsilon (cluster radius in meters) - LARGE WORKSPACE
dbscan_min_samples: 60          # Minimum points per cluster - LARGE WORKSPACE

# Temporal Smoothing
ema_alpha: 0.3                  # Exponential moving average weight (0-1)
max_history_len: 5              # Number of frames to keep for smoothing

# Color Detection (HSV Thresholds)
# Note: These are loaded in the node, but can be overridden here if needed
color_match_threshold: 0.3      # Minimum ratio of pixels matching color (0-1)
